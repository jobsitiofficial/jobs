Ace the Interview

Confidence
Speak clearly and make eye contact. Use examples of past projects to illustrate your experience. Ask thoughtful questions to show interest in the role. Avoid negative body language like slouching or fidgeting. The more comfortable and confident you seem, the better impression you'll make.

Follow Up

Landing the Job
After going through the interview process, you may receive one or more job offers. This is an exciting time, but don't let the excitement cause you to rush into accepting the first offer you get. Take time to properly evaluate each offer and negotiate for the best salary and benefits package.

Evaluating Offers
Compare the job titles, responsibilities, salaries, benefits, work schedules, and other offered terms side by side. Don't focus only on salary; benefits like health insurance and retirement plans can make a significant difference.

Factor in the work environment, culture, and opportunities for growth and advancement. Try to get a feel for this during the interviews. Going with the highest paying job won't necessarily lead to long-term satisfaction.

Consider the commute and work-life balance. Don't underestimate the drain of a long commute. Also think about any flexibility in schedule or remote work options.

Salary Negotiation
Research typical pay rates for the job title and location using sites like PayScale and Glassdoor. Use this data to counter any lowball offers.

Frame requests in terms of your skills and ability to deliver results. Show how you can add value, not just what you want.

Aim high with the initial ask, but be willing to consider alternatives like more vacation time or flexible scheduling if the base salary won't budge.

Get any negotiated terms in writing before accepting the offer. Verbal agreements often fail to materialize.

Onboarding Plan
Discuss timing and the planned onboarding process. Make sure you'll receive help getting up to speed on systems and duties.

Create a 30-60-90 day plan listing goals and ramp-up activities. Identify any training or introductions to people you'll need.

Schedule regular check-ins with your manager. Ask for feedback on your performance and advice for improving.

Immerse yourself in the organizational culture and build connections. Getting to know colleagues will smooth the transition.

Certifications
